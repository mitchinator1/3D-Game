- Fixed a huge unneccesary loop in the main loop. Blocks were being added and removed every call.
- Fixed camera movement, as well as set different moving pattern depending if in the overworld or a shop/dungeon.
- Updated grid.setLocation("location name") function, as well as data updated in hitDetect.
