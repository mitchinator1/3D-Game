Currently working on Camera movement. Plan is to add floating points away from the player to do a hitTest for the camera Boundaries.

Set up boundary blocks, to avoid confusion with regular blocks and camera being unneccessary locked.

Example: </br>

grid =
[[1, 1, 1, 1, 1],<br>
 [1, 0, 0, 0, 1],<br>
Â [1, 0, 0, 0, 1],<br>
 [1, 0, 0, 0, 1],<br>
 [1, 0, 0, 0, 1],<br>
 [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]<br>
 
 i = y and j = x
 when i = 0, all blocks boundary = true.
 when j = 0 or j = grid[i].length - 1, blocks boundary = true.
 when i = grid.length - 1, all blocks boundary = true.
 
 Only potential issue is with odd shaped rooms. Avoidable for y coordinate by having <b>only</b> first and last row have boundarys.
 Issue may arise with different column numbers.
